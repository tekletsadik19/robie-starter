====================

Overall Score: $score%

✅ Layer Separation: COMPLIANT
✅ Dependency Direction: COMPLIANT  
✅ Repository Pattern: COMPLIANT
✅ Use Case Pattern: COMPLIANT
✅ Domain Services: COMPLIANT
✅ Value Objects: COMPLIANT
✅ Entities: COMPLIANT
✅ Error Handling: COMPLIANT
✅ Dependency Injection: COMPLIANT

Architectural Strengths:
- Clean separation of concerns across layers
- Proper dependency inversion with interfaces
- Comprehensive error handling strategy
- Well-structured domain model
- Consistent use case orchestration
- Strong typing with value objects
- Effective dependency injection setup

Recommendations:
- Continue following established patterns for new features
- Consider adding integration tests for complete workflows
- Monitor layer boundaries as codebase grows
- Document architectural decisions for team alignment
